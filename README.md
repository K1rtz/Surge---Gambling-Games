## Plinko
Plinko is a game based on a grid of pegs where a ball is dropped from the top, bouncing off the pegs
until it lands in one of several slots at the bottom. The slots typically represent different prize values.
The path of the ball is determined by random collisions with the pegs, which introduces an element of chance to the game.

## Mines
Mines is a game of chance where players uncover tiles on a grid, each containing either a safe value, represented by a sakura flower, or a hidden mine, represented by a pumpkin.
The objective is to reveal as many safe tiles as possible without triggering a mine. The game features a set number of mines, and each successful reveal increases the potential reward.
The game ends when a mine is revealed, and the player loses their wager.

## Keno
Keno is a lottery-style game where players select a set of numbers from a predefined range. After the numbers are chosen, a random draw takes place, and a set of winning
numbers is selected. Players win by matching their chosen numbers with the drawn ones. The payout is determined by the number of matches, with larger payouts for more matches.
